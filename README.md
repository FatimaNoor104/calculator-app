# Calculator App using Streamlit
A powerful calculator with basic and advanced mathematical operations, built using Python and Streamlit.

****Overview****

This project is a Complex Calculator created using Python and the Streamlit framework. The app performs basic arithmetic operations and advanced mathematical functions such as exponentiation, square root, logarithms, and trigonometric calculations.

The calculator is built to be interactive and easy to use, providing an intuitive web interface where users can input numbers and select the desired operation.

****Features:****

- **Basic Operations:**

	- Addition

	- Subtraction

	- Multiplication

	- Division (with division by zero handling)

- **Advanced Operations:**

	- Power/Exponentiation

	- Square Root Calculation

	- Logarithms with customizable base (default is base 10)

- **Trigonometric Functions (inputs in degrees):**

	- Sine

	- Cosine

	- Tangent


- **Error Handling:** 

	- Handles errors such as division by zero, square roots of negative numbers, and logarithms of non-positive numbers.

****Technologies Used****

- Streamlit - Fastest way to build custom ML tools and data science apps in Python.
- Python's math library for handling mathematical calculations.
